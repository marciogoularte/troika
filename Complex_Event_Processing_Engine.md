# Introduction #

Complex Event Processing Engine


# Details #

Complex Event Processing features list:

  1. persisting simple events where a single event is defined as event(desc, timestamp)
  1. defining , finding the common relationships between events
  1. analyzing common event patterns and filtering event garbage
  1. event simulation
  1. identifying complex events based on the single event patterns
  1. associating complex events with workflow activities, object  lifecycles and business rules
  1. real time  or close to real time complex event processing
  1. monitoring, analyzing and filtering complex events
  1. building prediction matrix based on the historical events and real time complex events execution
  1. providing restful webservices, secure
  1. managing multi time data streams with complex events
  1. usage time series analysis
  1. transaction management support through complex event processing engine, framework
  1. identifying real time decisions based on the complex event clouds
  1. applying machine learning algorithms to complex event processing pipeline
  1. optimization through complex event processing
  1. able to process 100k events through complex event processing pipeline
  1. support on the fly modification and adjustment of complex event distribution
  1. event time synchronization for multiple same time complex event processing pipelines
  1. low latency infrastructure
  1. cep communication framework
  1. identifying even abstraction models from the applied business rules
  1. execution as a framework workflow engine-> rules engine->complex event processing engine->lifecycle engine
  1. event synchronization and decision making
  1. complex event processing streaming persistence, which can be implemented by using SQL database or non-SQL database with support of cloud deployment and distributed execution


The reference implementation of the business rule engine along with business process management engine/ workflow engine can be found at

http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/rule-engine and
http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/workflow-engine

Business rule engine reference implementation can be used as a library or
as a complete solution which can provide a full set of APIs for not only for business rule management but for workflow / business process management as well.
For example workflow engine delivers runtime execution, workflow engine template design, workflow persistence when its used as a platform. More details can be found at http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/workflow-engine help documentation for troika workflow engine.

Same thing is for rule engine, when its used as the platform from http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/rule-engine it delivers a full set of APIs and application layers for business rule management.
One of the major advantages of the http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/workflow-engine and http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/rule-engine from FlyingTroika is that it provides a seamless integration between different business engines like workflow, rule, complex event processing, machine learning lifecycle.
Another feature of the business process management  and business rule management is that both are working withing a single platform and allows easy to scale to working under high load of workflow activities execution or rules execution in runtime.
