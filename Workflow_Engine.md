#### Reference Implementation and Product for Workflow Engine, Business Process Management ####
There is product implementation based on the design which can be found
at http://www.flyingtroika.com/ workflow engine and rule engine implementation.

http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/workflow-engine

# Introduction #
Workflow Engine Framework can be integrated with any enterprise applications such as ERP (enterprise resource planning), PLM (product lifecycle management), CRM (customer relationship management) systems.

troika Workflow Engine has a high performance runtime execution APIs that can be used for integration, embedded execution, application development. And at the same time Workflow engine framework can be used as a standalone service or a server with UI workflow designer for workflow processes, administration console and persistence manager.

As a part of workflow processes execution and workflow design the rule engine can be used in such a way that rules can be defined for each workflow step or activity or even workflow transitions.

[Workflow\_Engine\_Design](Workflow_Engine_Design.md)

> workflow software usage:
able to create business processes, easy to install and configure in a cloud all workflow software, high performance workflow engine and process execution, flexible workflow administration, very intuitive design framework, can be extended to python, c++,c#, following module based approach. dynamic workflow templates generation.

The reference implementation of the business rule engine along with business process management engine/ workflow engine can be found at

http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/rule-engine and
http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/workflow-engine

Business rule engine reference implementation can be used as a library or
as a complete solution which can provide a full set of APIs for not only for business rule management but for workflow / business process management as well.
For example workflow engine delivers runtime execution, workflow engine template design, workflow persistence when its used as a platform. More details can be found at http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/workflow-engine help documentation for troika workflow engine.

Same thing is for rule engine, when its used as the platform from http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/rule-engine it delivers a full set of APIs and application layers for business rule management.
One of the major advantages of the http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/workflow-engine and http://www.flyingtroika.com/solutions/rule-engine from FlyingTroika is that it provides a seamless integration between different business engines like workflow, rule, complex event processing, machine learning lifecycle.
Another feature of the business process management  and business rule management is that both are working withing a single platform and allows easy to scale to working under high load of workflow activities execution or rules execution in runtime.
